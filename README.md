# Raysume ðŸ”®: Make your Resume Faster than Ever with AI

## Introduction
This project is a part of the IIT Gandhinagar 24' Software Development Club Hackathon. More about that below.

This project is a web-based application that helps users create resumes quickly by using the Groq AI API with minimal effort.

Users input their personal and professional details, and the app will automatically generate a well-structured, polished resume in a professional format.

The idea is to simplify the process of creating a resume by providing suggestions and formatting tips.

#### Problem Statement: Resume Builder using OpenAI/Groq AI API

The goal of this project is to build a web-based application that helps users create resumes quickly by using the OpenAI API/Groq AI API with minimal effort. Users will input their personal and professional details, and the app will automatically generate a well-structured, polished resume in a professional format. The idea is to simplify the process of creating a resume by providing suggestions and formatting tips.

#### Evaluation Criteria

1. Functionality: The website should perform the core tasks effectivelyâ€”taking user input, generating content with the OpenAI API, and creating both PDF and LaTeX resumes.
2. Ease of Use: The application should have a simple and intuitive user interface. Users shouldnâ€™t struggle to input their data or download the resume in both formats.
3. Content Quality: The AI-generated suggestions should be relevant and well-suited to the userâ€™s input, making the resume content stand out in a professional way.
4. API Usage: Ensure the efficient use of the OpenAI API, minimizing token usage while still generating high-quality content.

## Features

Main Features of the Project:
1. **AI Powered Content Suggestions**: The project uses the Groq API to generate resume content, generate questions, provide suggestions, review the resume and give valuable feedback and more.

2. **User Authentication**: The project uses Firebase Authentication to authenticate users and store their data securely.

3. **Resume Generation**: The project generates resumes in Mardown format as of now,  PDF and LaTeX formats will be supported in future versions!

4. **Real-Time Resume Preview**: The project provides a preview of the resume generated in Markdown format. The preivew is updated in real-time as the user inputs data.

5. **User Input Form**: The project provides a form for the user to input their personal and professional details. The form is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. It updates the resume preview in real-time.

6. **System Prompts**: The project provides prompts to the user to input data in a structured manner. This helps the AI generate better content

7. **Efficient Token API Usage**: The project optimizes the usage of the Groq API tokens to minimize costs. The project uses the tokens efficiently to generate high-quality content.

## Tech Stack
1. NextJS
2. Appwrite Authentication and Database
3. Typescript and Zod
4. Groq API - Gemma 7B Model
5. TailwindCSS and ShadCN
